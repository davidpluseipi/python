# Variables are like boxes or containers you store stuff in.

# Variable names are the labels on the boxes.

# Valid variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
apple = 5
user_input12 = "Name"
output_3 = user_input12

# Avoid Python keyword and function names, like...
# 
# and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, 
# exec, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, 
# None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, print, raise, return, True, try, while, 
# with, yield

# Variable names should be lowercase. Uppercase has special meaning.
